# Sadness Chan Redux
A chat 'bot' for FoundryVTT that's full of 'happy' and 'motivational' messages, to pick you up when your rolls let you down.

This is forked of off bmarian's sadness-chan: https://github.com/bmarian/sadness-chan. 

### Important Note
This module is a stripped down version, designed to send *happy* and _motivational_ messages whenever a critical success or failure happens.

# Installation
Like any other module, you dummy. Just go in the `Add-on Modules` section and click `Install Module`, if you don't find me there, use this link:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madebyhilmi/sadness-chan-redux/master/src/module.json

# Usage
Just play as you would usually do and Sadness Chan will send you 'happy' whispers if anything noteworthy happens.

But if you need more help just type `!sadness help` in the chat, and I will give you some more instructions.

### In case you are too special for any of my default settings, you can just change them, I guess...

### You can also modify all my 'cute' messages if any of them are too spicy for you `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

# Disclaimer
This module is a joke, and should be treated as such.
